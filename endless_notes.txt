TO REMEMBER:

*** infohash is the SHA1 hash of the info dictionary
from stackoverflow:
To get the infohash, bdecode the metafile, then it's simply "sha1(bencode(metadata['info']))" (i.e. bencode only the info dict again, then hash that).

*** netstat [-an] | grep <port_no>

*** lsof | grep <port_no>

*** ssh -X <hostname>
>hostname example: user@chromebox02
-X enables window display on the remote host
global variable is $DISPLAY
>echo $DISPLAY
>logout
