- Does each chunk have a metainfo file, or just the complete file does?
- Are .torrent files metafiles or files that also include the actual data?
- How does a client make itself known as a seeder to the tracker? (HTTP GET request when it asks for a file, but how about when it *has* a file?)
- Am I using TCP or UDP or both for the transfer?
- How do you know where to download the file from? (does the tracker give you a path / address, does that info come from the .torrent file? )
